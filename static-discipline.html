    <p> Description </p>
      <p style="width: 500px;">
        There are three sections in this demo. The left part shows a
        transfer function. On the right, there is a schematic showing
        a data line between two inverters that flips between high and
        low voltages. Below the schematic is the third section.  This
        is where noise can be seen accumulating on the data line. The
        red bars in each box correspond to the parameters dictated by
        the static discipline as set by the user on the interactive
        plot of the transfer function. To the far right, the noise
        tolerance is displayed, shown as the minimum of either the
        high noise margin or the low noise margin.

        This demo works best on chrome. It is known to work on linux and macos.
