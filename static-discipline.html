        <p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>
          There are three sections in this demo. The left part shows a
          transfer function. On the right, there is a schematic
          showing two inverters with a data line in between that flips
          between high and low voltages. Below the schematic is the
          third section.  This is where noise can be seen accumulating
          on the data line. The red bars in each box correspond to the
          parameters dictated by the static discipline as set by the
          user who manipulate the interactive plot of the transfer
          function. To the far right, the noise tolerance is
          displayed, shown as the minimum of the high and low noise
          margins.

          This demo works best on chrome. It is known to work on
          linux (sometimes android), macos, and windows7 with IE.

          Slower machines running firefox will probably have severe
          performance issues.
